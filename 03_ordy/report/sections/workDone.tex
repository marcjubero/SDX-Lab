\textit{We completed the given code for the causal and the total module, did a series of experiments with different values, especially for the network delay. With the help of the results of those experiments and consulting the appropiate documentation we were able to fill out this document. The work done can be found, throughout this document, in the Annex, also in the source code files attached.}
