\section{Introduction}

\textit{The main goal of this seminar is to implement a multicast service that supports different message orderings.
\newline We will have a set of workers that communicate with each other using multicast messages. Each worker will have access to a multicast process that will hide the complexity of the system. The multicast processes are connected to each other and will have to agree on an order on how to deliver the messages.}
