\section{Personal opinion}

\textit{It has been an interesting seminar despite of the difficulty.
Erlang is still a programming language that needs time to be interiorized.
The seminar itself has been a whole experience which illustrate different mechanisms of multicast communication, and how to implement them.\\
\newline The seminar itself is not very difficult. The difficult aspect is trying to understand the whole code and it's structure. It can be quite messy. Despite of all these things, it's a good seminar.
Multicasting is a very important aspect of distributed systems, for example for reliable information distribution, collaborative applications, etc, and in this seminar we see various approaches who differ in comlexity and functionalities. That is why we think it should be included in next year's seminar.
