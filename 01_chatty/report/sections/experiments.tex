\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Part one}
Try opening 2 or 3 clients and test that all of them receive all the messages. You can also try to communicate among different physical machines (remember to change the local IP line by the public IP of the server you are connecting to). Read the ’Erlang primer’ to refresh how to contact remote nodes. \\

\textit{This first part has been tested on a single machine. As we can see in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 the server notifies when a client joins or leaves the chat and how the server broadcasts all messages.\\
So we can asume a correct functionality of our code.}

\subsection{Part two}
Once you have a set of servers up and running, try connecting some clients to each of the server instances and begin to chat. Does it work?
You can also try to crash some of the servers and see what happens. \\

\textit{This second part has been tested on a single machine and on separated machines. The screenshots corresponds to the test on separated machines.
The results of the test can be found in the Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.}
