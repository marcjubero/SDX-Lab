\section{Work done}

\textit{We  implemented a chat application as a distributed system with Erlang in two versions, the first one with one centralized server, the second as a decentralized version with diferent servers to which the clients can connect. The first version was tested locally and the the second both locally and on different machines. 
\newline The work done can be found in the Annex, also in the source code files attached.}
