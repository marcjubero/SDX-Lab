\section{Work done}
\textit{We completed the given code for the modules gms1, which doesn't handle failures, gms2 whiche recovers from leader crashes by executing an election procedure, but might get out of sync and gms3 which recovers lost messages due to leader crashes. We  did a series of experiments
with different values, and with the help of the results of those
experiments and consulting the appropiate documentation we were able to fill out this
document. The work done can be found, throughout this document, in the Annex, also in
the source code files attached.}
