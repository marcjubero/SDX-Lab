\section{Introduction}

\textit{In this assignment we have implemented a group membership service that provides atomic multicast.
\newline As the multicast layer provides total order, all nodes are synchronized.
\newline The challenge in this seminar is to achieve that the nodes maintain this synchronization although nodes might join the view or crash. }
