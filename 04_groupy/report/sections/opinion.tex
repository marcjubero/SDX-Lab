\section{Personal opinion}

\textit{At this point of the course, Erlang is not a barrier to achieve to complete the whole seminar. The main difficulty is to understant the main goal of the seminar, extract an enough clear idea and try to implement the differnt parts of the seminar.
After spend few hours, we can conclude that this seminar is a good way to understand how atomic multicast works, pros and cons, and get a general view of the topic.}
