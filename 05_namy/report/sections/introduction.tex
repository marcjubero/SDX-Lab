\section{Introduction}

\textit{
\newline The main goal of this seminar is to illustrate how works a distributed name server. To this purpose we design a simple architecture based on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Server}, responsible for a domain and hold a set of registered hosts.
    \item \textbf{Resolvers}, help the clients to find the hosts address.
    \item \textbf{Hosts}, nodes with name and registered on a server.
    \item \textbf{Clients}, only know the address of a resolver. Clients have to use resolvers to find hosts addresses.
\end{itemize}
Clients will send a ping message that will be answered by hosts.
