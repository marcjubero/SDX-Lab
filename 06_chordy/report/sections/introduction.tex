\section{Introduction}

\textit{In this assignment we have developed a distributed hash table following the Chord scheme. \newline We've developed 4 versions of the same concept, the first one is the basic one which just maintains the ring structure and over which we've construct the other ones, adding sorage, failure handling and finally storage replication.}
